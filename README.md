# Groupwise, rigid medical image alignment

MATLAB implementation of an algorithm for groupwise, between modality coregistration using a normalised joint total variation (NJTV) cost function. To run, simply give a bunch of nifti files (as char array or SPM nifti() object). 

The code requires that SPM12 and SPM's auxiliary-functions toolbox is on the MATLAB path:

* SPM12 - download from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download

* SPM's auxiliary-functions - git clone from https://github.com/WTCN-computational-anatomy-group/auxiliary-functions

That's it!
